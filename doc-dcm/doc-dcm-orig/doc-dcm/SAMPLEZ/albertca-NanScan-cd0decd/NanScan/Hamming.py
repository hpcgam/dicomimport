## @brief This class calculates the Hamming distance between two strings.
#
# When two given characters differ completely they add 2 to the final distance
# between the strings. Two 'similar' characters (defined by the given translator
# or the default translator if none specified) will add 1 and 0 for two 
# identical characters.
#
# This distinction of 'similar' and 'different' characters can be useful to 
# 'correct' OCR defects.
