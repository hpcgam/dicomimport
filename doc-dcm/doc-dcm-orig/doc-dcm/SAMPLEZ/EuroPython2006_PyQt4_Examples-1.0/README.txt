This package contains the examples we presented at EuroPython 2006 at CERN,
Geneva, Switzerland in our talk, "Introducing PyQt4 for GUI Application
Development", available from the conference Web site:

http://indico.cern.ch/contributionDisplay.py?contribId=33&sessionId=41&confId=44

The examples are grouped into directories with names that match the titles of
some slides. To get the most out of the talk and examples, try running those
examples while you read the relevant slides.

Thanks to Torsten for writing some complex model/view examples at short
notice and agreeing to release them under the GPL. To use them, you'll need
to install the Python bindings to SQLite 3 (confusingly released as the
pysqlite2 module) and the ElementTree XML handling library. With the
exception of the OpenGL examples, which require PyOpenGL to be installed,
most other examples require nothing more than a working PyQt4 installation.

The examples are made available under the GNU General Public License.
Examples that are ports of C++ examples from the Qt Open Source distribution
are licensed under version 2.0 of the license. Examples written by us are
licensed under version 2 or later of the license.
